# Todo List Frontend Project

## Description

This repository contains a frontend project focused on creating an interactive todo list using pure vanilla JavaScript. A Todo list made with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript is a basic tool for organizing tasks. Users can add, delete, and mark tasks as complete. The interface includes a form for inputting tasks and a list for displaying them. JavaScript adds functionality like updating task status and filtering tasks.. By building this todo list, I am exploring fundamental concepts in JavaScript while creating a valuable tool for managing daily tasks.

## Key Features

- Add, edit, and remove tasks dynamically.
- Mark tasks as complete or incomplete with visual indicators.
- User-friendly interface with modern CSS styling.
- Utilization of local storage for persistent task data.
- Interactive user experience through event-driven programming.
